# Photoelectric Effect Simulation App

![Project Image](https://vanessawithun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example2.png)  

## Overview  
This Streamlit app demonstrates the **photoelectric effect**, where light behaves like particles (photons) when it hits a metal surface, causing electrons to be ejected. It helps visualize the relationship between **light frequency** and the **stopping voltage** required to prevent current from flowing.

With the app, you can:  
- **Explore the light spectrum** using a slider or spectrum bar.  
- **See color transitions** smoothly across the spectrum.  
- **Visualize the voltage vs. frequency** relationship with a live-updating graph.  
- **Learn how higher-frequency photons** have more energy to eject electrons.

## How to Use  
1. **Move the slider** or **drag across the spectrum bar** to select a frequency.
2. **Observe color changes** on the slider and the spectrum as the frequency changes.
3. **Check the graph** for how the voltage changes with the selected frequency. A red dot shows the current voltage value.
4. **Experiment** with different frequencies and explore how **higher frequencies** require more voltage to stop the electrons from flowing.
